# Adobe Illustrator Scripting Resources

Two of my biggest hurdles learning ExtendScript & ScriptUI have been the broken resource links everywhere, and Adobe's maze of un-documentation. I hope this page helps you in some way :)


## Essentials

* Peter Kahrel: [ScriptUI for Dummies](https://creativepro.com/files/kahrel/indesign/scriptui.html) (InDesign, but plenty realavent)
* Joonas Pääkkö: [ScriptUI Dialog Builder](https://scriptui.joonas.me/)
* Adobe: [Javascript Tools Guide CC](https://estk.aenhancers.com/index.html)
* Adobe: [Adobe Illustrator Scripting Guide](https://illustrator-scripting-guide.readthedocs.io/)
* fabiantheblind: [ExtendScript Wiki](https://github.com/ExtendScript/wiki/wiki)


## ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK)

[Download Adobe ESTK](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ExtendScript-Toolkit) 

You won't find this link via Google, the CC app, or Adobe support because Adobe is pushing developers towards their Extend Script Debugger extension for VS Code.


## Visual Studio Code

In 2019, Adobe released the ExtendScript Debugger extenstion for VS Code. Debugger is meant to replace ETSK.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [ExtendScript Syntax Highlighting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hennamann.jsx)
* [Adobe ExtendScript Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.extendscript-debug)

I haven't tried ESTK. I have tried Debugger and it made me cry - I got it working for 2 hours before it went hinky. I still haven't gotten it to work again. 


## Sublime Text

[ExtendScript Package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/ExtendScript) - Intended to be used in conjunction with ESTK.
