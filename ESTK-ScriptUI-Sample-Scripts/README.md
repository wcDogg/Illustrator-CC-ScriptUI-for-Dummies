# Adobe ESTK ScriptUI Sample Scripts

These are the sample scripts distributed with [Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK)](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ExtendScript-Toolkit). Included here becsue ScriptUI examples are hard to find and maybe you don't use ESTK. 

Note the zip file - it contains all the ESTK sample scripts listed here. 

I haven't gone through these yet, so I'm not sure they're all relavent to Illustrator.
