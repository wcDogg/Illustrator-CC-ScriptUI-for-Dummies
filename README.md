# Adobe Illustrator CC ScriptUI for Dummies

**The misadventures of a technical writer trying to learn ExtendScript & ScriptUI for Illustrator.**

This project was inspired by people I've never met or spoken with: 

* Above all are the awesome people who take time to answer forum questions & post script examples <3 
* Peter Kahrel maintains [ScriptUI for Dummies](https://creativepro.com/files/kahrel/indesign/scriptui.html) - this project's namesake. I would have been lost without his guide. I also got lost because of his guide :P
* Joonas Pääkkö maintains the [ScriptUI Dialog Builder](https://scriptui.joonas.me/). I can't imagine learning or writing ScriptUI without this tool :) 
* I was also inspired by Adobe's maze of un-documentation and broken resource links. Thanks, Adobe?
