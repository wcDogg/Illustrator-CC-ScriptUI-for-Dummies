# Adobe Illustrator CC ScriptUI for Dummies

**The misadventures of a technical writer trying to learn ExtendScript & ScriptUI for Illustrator.**

If you landed here because you're in the middle of scripting something, [head straight to the Wiki](https://github.com/wcDogg/Illustrator-CC-ScriptUI-for-Dummies/wiki).

## About

This is a project for people who want to get more out of Illustrator and, either have somee basic JavaScript skills, or aren't afraid to try. It was inspired by people I've never met or spoken with: 

* Above all are the awesome people who take time to answer forum questions & post script examples <3 
* Peter Kahrel maintains [ScriptUI for Dummies](https://creativepro.com/files/kahrel/indesign/scriptui.html) - this project's namesake. I would have been lost without his guide. I also got lost because of his guide :P
* Joonas Pääkkö maintains the [ScriptUI Dialog Builder](https://scriptui.joonas.me/). I can't imagine learning or writing ScriptUI without this tool :) 
* I was also inspired by Adobe's maze of un-documentation and broken resource links. Thanks, Adobe? 

I'm a technical writer & information architect. Documenting what I learn is something I've always done. I'm not a JavaScript guru. I'm just starting ExtendScript & ScriptUI. 

Where Peter's guide uses examples for InDesign, this project is about Illustrator. And unlike the bare-bones refrence guides intended for developers who already know what they're doing, this project is written for learners and I sincerely hope it helps you in some way :)
